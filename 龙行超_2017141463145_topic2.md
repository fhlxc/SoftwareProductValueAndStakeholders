Four days of theoretical guidance, combined with three practical exercises, has a profound understanding of the content of this course. Here, according to the three assignments and classroom guidance, the summary of the course is as follows：
1. Part one——goal needs and value
- goals & requirements
> Goals <> Requirements
> - Goals belong to different stakeholders
> - Goals may conflict
> - Goals indicate what is hoped for
> Articulating the goals is a great starting point, and needs are
transformed into stakeholder requirements
- the elemets of value
> type | value
> -- | --
> SOCIAL IMPACT | Self-transcendence
> LIFE CHANGING | Provides hope; Self-actualization; Motivation; Heirloom; Affiliation/belonging
> EMOTIONAL | Reduces anxiety; Rewards me; Nostalgia; Design/aesthetics; Badge value; Weliness; Therapeutic value; Fun/entertainment; Attractiveness; Provides access
> FUNCTIONAL | Saves time; Simplifies; Makes Money; Reduces risk; Organizes; Integrates; Connects; Reduces effort; Avoids hassles; Reduces cost; Quality; Variety; Sensory appeal; Informs
2. Part two——vision & scope & stakeholders
- version
    - describes what the product is about and what it eventually could become
    - Communicates the strategic intent for product development
        - Why are we building this product, system, or application?
        - What problems will it solve?
        - What feature and benefit will it provide?
        - For whom does it provide these features and benefits?
        - What performance, reliability and scalability must it deliver?
        - What platforms, standards, applications, etc. will it support?
- scope
    - work content of a project
    - activities
- version & scope
> object | content
> -- | --
> vision | Applies to the whole product development program; changes relatively slowly
> scope | Pertains to a specific project/iteration; Be more dynamic than vision; Project managers adjust the contents of each release
- Template for vision and scope document
> title | content
> -- | --
> Business requirements | Background; Business opportunity; Business objectives and success criteria; Vision statement; Business risks; Business assumptions and dependencies
> Scope and limitations | Major features; Scope of initial release; Scope of subsequent releases; Limitations and exclusions
> Business context | Stakeholder profiles; Project priorities; Operating environment
- Stakeholders, customers and users
> object | content
> -- | --
> Stakeholders | Anyone who is affected by, or can influence the outcome of a project;  Includes customers, regulators, managers, analysts, developers, testers, doc writers, legalstaff, sales, support, manufactoring, auditors
> Customers/Clients | An individual or organization who derives direct or indirect benefit from a product; Could request, pay for, select, specify, or use the product
> Users |  Someone who directly or indirectly interacts with the system, provides inputs to it, or receives output from it
- Stakeholder identification
    - Baseline stakeholders -> à the network of stakeholders
    - combination of following techniques/sources is useful for exploring the network of stakeholders
        - By asking your sponsor or client
        - With a template such as the checklist
        - By comparing with the similar projects
        - By analyzing the context of the project
3. Part three——before requirements analysis
- sources of input
    - Various stakeholders
        - Interviews
        - Observing users at work
        - Meetings, workshops
    - Pre-existing documentation 
        - Documents that describe current or competing products or neighboring products
        - Problem reports and enhancement requests for a system-as-is
        - Marketing surveys and user questionnaires
        - Standards, policies, collective agreements, etc.
    - External sources
        - Other companies, vendors, domain experts, on-line data services, etc.
- techniques
    - Interviews: The requirements engineer or analyst discusses the system with different stakeholders and builds up an understanding of their requirements
    - Laddering: Laddering is performed on the basis of a one-to-one interviewing technique, and starts out by focusing on a certain product or service and its attributes
    - Brainstorming: A simple group technique for generating ideas
    - Observation and enthnographic studies
    - JAD: Joint Application Design
    - Prototyping: A software requirements prototype is a mock-up or partial implementation of a software system
    - Scenarios: A set of interaction scenarios can be used to elicit and clarify system requirements
    - Reuse: Reuse involves taking the requirements which have been developed for one system and using them in a different system
    - Card sorting: Cards and items; Examines perceptions of categories and criteria; Sort cards into groups; Hierarchical and non-hierarchical sorts
